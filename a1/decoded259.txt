the following problem can be solved either the easy way or the hard waytwo trains  miles apart are moving toward each other each one is goingat a speed of  miles per hour a fly starting on the front of one ofthem flies back and forth between them at a rate of  miles per hour itdoes this until the trains collide and crush the fly to death  what is thetotal distance the fly has flownthe fly actually hits each train an infinite number of times before it getscrushed and one could solve the problem the hard way with pencil and paperby summing an infinite series of distances  the easy way is as followssince the trains are  miles apart and each train is going  miles anhour it takes  hours for the trains to collide  therefore the fly wasflying for two hours since the fly was flying at a rate of  miles perhour the fly must have flown  miles that is all there is to itwhen this problem was posed to john von neumann he immediately replied milesit is very strange said the poser but nearly everyone tries to sum theinfinite serieswhat do you mean strange asked von neumann  that is how i did it
