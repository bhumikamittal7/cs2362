Write a program to implement the following encryption scheme 

- Setup: The setup describes the building blocks used by the scheme. They are as follows:
(a) A PRG G : {0, 1}^80 → {0, 1}^160. Consider using one of the candidate PRGs discussed in the course (subset sum PRG).

- KeyGen(180): The key space is set to K = {0, 1}^80. The KeyGen algorithm samples a random key k$← {0, 1}^80. 
You must write your own program to sample uniformly from the key space.

- Enc: The encryption algorithm takes a message and a key k as input. The messages are allowed to be any text/textfile with size at most 80 bits. 
Use appropriate encoding to convert your text message into a unique m ∈ {0, 1}^160. The encryption then proceeds as follows:

- Pick r $← {0, 1}^80
- Compute z = G(k ⊕ r) ⊕ m
- Output ciphertext C = (r, z)
You may choose an appropriate encoding for representing the ciphertext into a text file.

- Dec: The input to the decryption algorithm is a ciphertext file and a key k. The decryption is carried out as follows:
(a) Parse the ciphertext as (r, z)
(b) Compute m = G(k ⊕ r) ⊕ z
(c) Decode m to its text representation and output it as the decrypted message
